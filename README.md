# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions, Docker, and AKS

This project demonstrates a production-style CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds, tests, containerizes, and deploys a Node.js application to **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** using **GitHub Actions**, **Docker**, and secure **OIDC authentication**.

The goal of this repository is to showcase real-world DevOps practices: automated pipelines, immutable artifacts, secure cloud authentication, and Kubernetes-based deployments.
